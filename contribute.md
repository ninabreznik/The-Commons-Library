# 🤝 How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **The Commons Library**!  
This project is building **a decentralized library of community projects and open social business models**.  
We believe everyone—whether you’re a community organiser, writer, designer, tech-enthusiast or volunteer—has something valuable to add.

## 🧩 Ways you can help

Here are the main ways you can contribute:

### 1. Add a new project blueprint  
You can help by **documenting a replicable social project**.  
For example:  
- Research and describe how a real-world project works (mission, operations, impact).  
- Write a step-by-step guide on how someone could start the project in their own community.  
- Create a communication / onboarding guide: how to recruit people, share the story, build the community.  
- Write about funding, donations, sustainability: how the project keeps going, how to accept funds, how part of the funds support the shared infrastructure.  
- (Optional) Document any tech tools, peer-to-peer stack, or digital workflows used.  
- Add real-life examples, links, context, and a “meta.json” for indexing.

Use the folder structure in `/projects/<project-name>/` (per the template) and fill in the files.

### 2. Improve existing project documentation  
Maybe you spot a project blueprint that could be clearer, needs a translation, or could use updated examples. You can:  
- Suggest edits or enhancements via a Pull Request (PR).  
- Add additional context, resources, or a “lessons learned” section.  
- Translate a project into another language to make it more accessible.

### 3. Help shape the library itself  
Beyond the project blueprints, you can help build the infrastructure, process and community:  
- Suggest improvements to the documentation structure or naming conventions.  
- Help define how the donation / value-sharing model flows.  
- Write blog posts, case-studies, or share stories of local replication.  
- Help moderate or curate new submissions and ensure quality/logistics.  
- Spread the word: invite community groups, local libraries, activists to join and contribute.

### 4. Non-tech roles count big  
You don’t need to be a coder. Here are many non-technical ways to contribute:  
- Research and write a project guide.  
- Provide feedback as a local community organiser: “What would I need?”  
- Design visuals or diagrams (flowcharts, process maps).  
- Translate content into your language.  
- Offer to host a local workshop or talk about the Commons Library concept.  
- Connect us with libraries, nonprofits, local councils who might replicate a project.

## 📋 Guidelines & good practices  
- Please keep contributions **clear, inclusive and practical** — aim to help someone in a small community set this up locally.  
- Use plain language, assume minimal prior experience.  
- Keep the structure defined in the template so everything stays consistent and easy to browse.  
- Include sources, links, and credit where appropriate.  
- The content you submit should be licensed under an open license (e.g., CC BY-SA) so others can reuse and adapt it.  
- Be respectful and collaborative. We encourage open-ness, shared learning, and generosity.

- It will be reviewed by the maintainers (typically within a few days).  
- You may receive feedback or requests for edits or additions.  
- When ready, your contribution will be merged and visible on the site.  
- You will be acknowledged in the contributor list.
