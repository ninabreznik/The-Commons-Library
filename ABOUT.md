# 🌍 The Commons Library
*A value-sharing, decentralized library of open, replicable social projects.*

---

### 💡 Mission
The Commons Library is a **decentralized library of community projects and open social business models**.  
Our goal is to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to start meaningful local projects that strengthen their communities — from food co-ops and repair cafés to community currencies or local learning hubs.

Each project in the library comes with:
- 🧩 **A clear description** of how the project works  
- ⚙️ **Open-source tech tools** (when relevant)  
- 📖 **Guides for onboarding people, communicating, and running operations**  
- 💰 **Advice on funding, donations, and long-term sustainability**

Everything is open and reusable — so a local group can simply **fork a project**, adapt it to their context, and begin.

---

### 💧 Sustaining the Commons
Our goal isn’t just to share blueprints, but to help every project be financially **sustainable**.  
Each local initiative can receive its own donations or funding, while a small portion of those funds can flow **back to the Commons Library** to maintain this shared infrastructure — keeping the whole ecosystem alive and self-sustaining.

### 🤝 Collaboration
Right now, we’re in the early phase — **building the library together**.  
The most valuable contribution at this stage is to help us **gather and document replicable social projects**:

- Describe how an existing project works  
- Show real-life examples  
- Write a guide on how to start and run this project locally  
- Add notes on communication, community-building, funding, and operations  

You don’t need to be technical to contribute — this is about **sharing practical knowledge** and making it reusable.

### 🌱 Long-term vision
The Commons Library aims to become a **global peer-to-peer knowledge commons**, where:
- Projects are distributed and hosted by the people who use them  
- Communities can replicate and adapt what works  
- Funding circulates fairly to support both local action and shared infrastructure  

> Explore. Fork. Rebuild your community.

### 🧭 Next Steps

We’re continuously expanding the Commons Library with new examples of open, replicable social projects.  
If you know a project that belongs here, or if you’ve built one yourself, please see [**contribute.md**](contribute.md) to learn how to add it.
