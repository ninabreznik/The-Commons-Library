### 📱 Internal Communication

For small community projects like this, internal coordination is minimal —  
but you might use these tools if multiple people share responsibility:

| Channel | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| WhatsApp / Signal group | For co-stewards to coordinate maintenance |
| Shared Google Doc | Track restocking, volunteer days, donations |

### 🌍 External Communication

| Channel | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Instagram / Facebook | Post photos of new books or community interactions |
| Local newspaper / radio | Share human-interest stories |
| Flyers | Place around cafes, schools, and libraries to spread the word |
| Little Free Library Map | Optional listing to appear on global map |
