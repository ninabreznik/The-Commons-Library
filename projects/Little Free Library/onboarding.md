### 👣 For Organizers

1. **Choose a location** — visible, safe, and accessible to all (your front yard, a school fence, or a park).  
2. **Build your box** — DIY with reclaimed wood or order a pre-built one.  
3. **Stock it** — add a few books for all ages and genres to start.  
4. **Add signage** — simple “Take a book, leave a book” message.  
5. **Register (optional)** — join the official [Little Free Library Map](https://littlefreelibrary.org/).  
6. **Host a launch event** — invite neighbors to bring their favorite books and celebrate.
