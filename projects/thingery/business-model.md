# Business Model

The Thingery operates on a **community membership model**.

## Revenue Streams
- **Membership fees:** Small monthly or yearly fee (e.g. £20–£40/year).
- **Donations:** Local supporters, crowdfunding, or small grants.
- **Workshops:** Hosting repair events or skill-sharing sessions.
- **Corporate sponsorships:** Local businesses contributing tools or funding.

## Cost Structure
- Rent or storage space.
- Maintenance and repairs of borrowed items.
- Software or platform (can be open-source or self-hosted).
- Volunteer coordination / community events.

## Sustainability
- Keep it small and local to minimize overhead.
- Encourage a donation flow where a small percentage (e.g. 5%) of local donations can be redirected to the **Commons Library** infrastructure fund, helping sustain the global ecosystem of open, replicable projects.
