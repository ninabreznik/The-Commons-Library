# Funding and Donations

1. **Membership Fees**: predictable, small recurring revenue.  
2. **Local Grants**: city sustainability programs, climate funds.  
3. **Crowdfunding**: community campaigns, e.g. via Open Collective or Patreon.  
4. **Local Sponsors**: hardware stores or repair shops providing discounts or donations.  
5. **Value Sharing**: optionally, set up a donation flow where a small share supports the Commons Library infrastructure, sustaining the global network.
