3. **Collect items** — start with donated kids’ clothes and toys  
4. **Create membership structure** — simple recurring donation or volunteer swap model  
5. **Host an opening day** — invite local parents and spread the word  
6. **Document your process** — photos, stories, and improvements to share with others
