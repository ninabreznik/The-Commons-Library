# Mission — NE Swap & Play

NE Swap & Play exists to make **family life more connected, sustainable, and supported**.  
It’s built on the belief that when we **share resources locally**, we all thrive together.

### 🎯 Goals

- Create a safe, inclusive space for parents and caregivers to meet
- Support local families with flexible, affordable access to what they need
- Inspire other communities to start their own version

### 💡 Vision

A city full of interconnected Swap & Play spaces — each locally run,  
but part of a shared global commons of open, community-driven infrastructure.
