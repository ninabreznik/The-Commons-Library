## 🔄 4. Peer-to-Peer Option (Experimental)

The **Commons Library** will soon support optional peer-to-peer publishing using **Hypercore / DAT**.  
This means your data (member list, documentation, etc.) can live on your own computer instead of the cloud.

- **Why it matters:** no central servers, no costs, full ownership.  
- **How to join:** this section will be updated once the Commons Hub P2P layer is ready.
