## 🔄 4. Peer-to-Peer (Experimental)

The **Commons Library** is developing a way for local Thingeries to publish and sync their inventory **peer-to-peer**,  
using **Hypercore** or **DAT** — no servers, no cloud costs, and total data ownership.

- **Why it matters:** helps communities collaborate without dependence on central platforms.  
- **How to prepare:**  
  - Keep your data structured (CSV or JSON)  
  - When P2P sync is ready, you’ll be able to share your inventory directly with other Thingeries.

## 🧭 5. Setup Checklist

✅ Choose your inventory system (MyTurn, Lend Engine, or Sheets)  
✅ Create shared folders for documentation and photos  
✅ Label all items with QR codes  
✅ Set up a donation page via Open Collective  
✅ Create a simple online presence (GitHub Page or Carrd)  
✅ Share your version back to the Commons Library if you fork it

## 💬 6. Tips for Tech Stewardship

- Keep all logins and credentials documented and accessible to at least two people.  
- Use open formats (.csv, .md, .pdf) so your data can move easily between systems.  
- Encourage **tech transparency** — anyone in the community should understand how the system works.  
- Share improvements and templates back to the **Commons Library** so other Thingeries can benefit.

**✨ In short:**  
Your Thingery’s digital layer should be open, transparent, and resilient —  
just like your lending model itself.
