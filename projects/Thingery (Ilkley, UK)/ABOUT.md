## 🌍 Summary

The **Thingery** is a **community library of things** — a place where people can borrow tools, camping gear, kitchen appliances, or other useful items instead of buying them.  

This reduces waste, saves money, and builds stronger, more connected communities.  
Anyone can replicate this idea locally by setting up a shared inventory, membership system, and simple borrowing policies.

## 🧩 What makes it replicable

- It requires **no new technology** — just organization, space, and a lending system.  
- It’s **community-driven**, often run by volunteers.  
- The model can scale: from a shelf in a library to a full warehouse.  
- **Funding** can come from memberships, small grants, or donations.
