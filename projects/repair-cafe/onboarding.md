### 👣 For Organizers

1. **Gather a small team** — people passionate about fixing and community.  
2. **Find a space** — community hall, library, school, or maker space.  
3. **Collect tools** — focus on general repair kits: screwdrivers, sewing supplies, glue, tape, multimeter, etc.  
4. **Choose a date** — monthly or bi-monthly works well.  
5. **Promote your first event** — through posters, social media, and word-of-mouth.  
6. **Set up simple stations** — electronics, clothing, furniture, bikes, etc.  
7. **Welcome visitors warmly** — explain the idea, log items, and celebrate every fix.
