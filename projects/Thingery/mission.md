# Mission

The Thingery exists to **make access more important than ownership**.

It helps communities:
- Share tools and useful items.
- Reduce unnecessary consumption and waste.
- Build trust and collaboration between neighbours.
- Support sustainability and repair culture.

This project aligns with the global movement for **circular economy** and **local resilience**.

By replicating this project, your community can:
- Cut down landfill waste.
- Save residents money.
- Create local engagement opportunities.
- Teach repair and sharing values to children and families.
